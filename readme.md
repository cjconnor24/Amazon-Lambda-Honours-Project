# Research Question
Does the choice of runtime have an impact on the Cold Start problem with Serverless architecture?

# Artefact
Todo List API

## Deployment instructions
You *must* have the (serverless framework)[http://serverless.com/] installed to deploy these to AWS.

Run the following to deploy all instances to AWS.
```
$: ./deploy.sh
```

*Note:* You must make sure that there is a JAR file which has been built for the Java API. If not, you can build using Maven:
```
$: mvn clean install
```
